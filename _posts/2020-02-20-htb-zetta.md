# **HTB:Zetta**

Zetta box was a hard box among other boxes till I have done. It falls under linux and hard category especially to read the root flag is a quite tough one. I'll approach this write-up how I have solved it, along with the problems that I have faced during this box. At first I had obtained the user flag using ipv6 and rsync service by uploading my authorized_keys then I had used postgres along with logger to read root.txt .I'll show all my payload(including that didn't work in initial deployment to get the root).

From above picture it's ip is 10.10.10.156, I added it to /etc/hosts as zetta.htb. Let's solve this box.

# **Recon**

Let's start with our universal port scanner `nmap` to see the open port and service which shows FTP(TCP 21),SSH(TCP 22) and HTTP(TCP 80).


```shell

root@gr4n173:~$ sudo nmap -sS -sV -sC -Pn -oN nmap.txt 10.10.10.156

### Web Enumeration
**_zetta.htb_**

After I noticed port 80 opened I had visited that site and got this as output.

Then, I searched every part of this website and found something interesting things in
