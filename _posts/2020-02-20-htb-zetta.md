# HTB:Zetta

Zetta box was a hard box among other boxes till I have done and feels quite fun while playing. It falls under linux and hard category especially to read the root flag is a quite tough one. I'll approach this write-up how I have solved it, along with the problems that I have faced during this box. At first I had obtained the user flag using ipv6 and rsync service by uploading my authorized_keys then I had used postgres along with logger to read root.txt .I'll show all my payload(including that didn't work in initial deployment to get the root).

From above picture it's ip is 10.10.10.156, I added it to /etc/hosts as zetta.htb. Let's solve this box.

# Recon

Let's start with our universal port scanner `nmap` to see the open *port* and service which shows FTP(TCP 21),SSH(TCP 22) and HTTP(TCP 80).


```shell

### Web Enumeration
**_zetta.htb_**

After I noticed _port 80_ opened I visited that site and got this as output.

Then, I searched every part of this website and found something interesting things in 

>STUFF TO DO

> Native FTP We support native FTP with FXP enabled. We also support RFC2428.

and also the credentials username/password for FTP service as below.
