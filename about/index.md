# About Me



Hi there, I am a nerd guy who loves everything in between Internet and Security. Reaching out to people and teaching about CyberSecurity is what I love. I like to play with electronics in my spare time so that I can automate my lifestyle. Though loving techology and infosec is one part, I m a nature admire too who love to travel and enjoy the beauty of nature.
